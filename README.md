## Machine 2 Machine Protocol

This proof-of-concept (PoC) project demonstrates autonomous economic interactions between AI Agents, modeled as services. In this architecture, agents can request tasks from other agents based on their domain expertise and reword them via x402 payments. It is a practical implementation of a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) economy, where agents interact using emerging protocols like Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and x402, running on top of MCP and Base network.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol

A2A is an open-source framework from Google that enables autonomous AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate securely. It provides a standardized protocol for agents, even those built on different platforms, to negotiate capabilities, delegate tasks, and coordinate actions. This creates an interoperable ecosystem where specialized agents can work together to automate complex workflows and solve problems more effectively.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is an open standard from Anthropic that serves as the semantic backbone for AI systems. It standardizes how agents connect to external data sources and tools, acting as a universal "connector" that gives an agent secure, on-demand access to the context it needsâ€”whether from a database, a file system, or a third-party API. MCP ensures that agents operate with a shared, coherent understanding of the information and capabilities required to execute tasks accurately.

### x402 Payments Protocol

The x402 protocol is an open standard from Coinbase for internet-native payments, designed for both humans and autonomous AI agents. It leverages the standard HTTP 402 Payment Required status code to create a seamless, low-friction way to pay for API calls, data access, or services rendered by other agents. Built to be chain-agnostic and trust-minimizing, x402 enables on-chain micropayments without the overhead of traditional financial systems, paving the way for a programmable economy where agents can autonomously transact for services.
